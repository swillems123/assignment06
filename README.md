 Diabetes Regression Models
Overview
A simple Python script that compares three regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to predict diabetes progression using the Scikit-Learn diabetes dataset.

Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
Usage
Run the script directly:

What it does
Loads the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn
Splits data into training and testing sets
Builds and compares three regression models
Evaluates models using common metrics (RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE)
Visualizes results including feature importance and prediction accuracy
Automatically determines the best performing model
Output
The script will display:

Performance metrics for each model
Feature importance visualization
Actual vs. predicted values plot for the best model
